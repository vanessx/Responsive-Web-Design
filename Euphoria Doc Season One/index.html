                <p>As a child, Ruby Bennett struggled with mental disorders and her father's death from cancer, which led to a 
                    drug addiction. Now 16, "Rue" returns home from rehab and immediately goes to her dealer Fezco ("Fez") for drugs. 
                    Jules, a new trans girl in town, is invited by her classmate, Kat, to a party hosted by popular college freshman 
                    Christopher McKay. Before the party, Jules hooks up at a motel with an older man from a hookup app after lying 
                    about her age. At the party, Kat loses her virginity. McKay's high school girlfriend Cassie gets upset when he 
                    chokes her during sex, but he stops and they discuss it. Maddy, who recently broke up with star quarterback Nate, 
                    has public revenge sex with Tyler, who she just met at the party. Angered by this, Nate drunkenly harasses Jules, 
                    and she threatens him with a knife before cutting her arm. Rue introduces herself to Jules and goes home with her. 
                    Nate returns home and encounters his father, Cal, who was Jules's hookup.</p>

                    Rue breaks down in front of the class after being asked to talk about her summer. Afterwards, Cassie's sister

                     with Nate, who catfishes her by adopting the name "Tyler" and the username "shyguy118". McKay spends time with 
                     Cassie and accuses her of being too sexual. Mouse, Fezco's intimidating supplier, coerces Rue into trying fentanyl.</p>

                <p>A young Katherine Hernandez abruptly gains weight on a family vacation. Her middle-school boyfriend, Daniel, 
                    breaks up with her. She retreats into the world of romance and becomes a popular online fan fiction writer. 
                    In the present, Kat starts to work as a camgirl, catering to a series of submissive men with financial domination 
                    fetishes. Jules tells Rue she will stop being friends with her if she keeps using drugs. At her Narcotics 
                    Anonymous meeting, Rue says she is 60 days sober; another attendee, Ali, tells her he knows she is lying. Rue 
                    helps Jules take nude photos of herself after Nate sends her a "dick pic", and she steals pills from Jules's 
                    kitchen. Maddy is shocked to find pictures of penises on Nate's phone. Rue and Jules argue after Jules reveals 
                    her plans to meet "Tyler" alone at night. Shortly thereafter, Rue goes to Jules's house to apologize and ends 
                    up kissing her. Panicked at the thought of alienating Jules, Rue visits Fez to get drugs, but, afraid for her 
                    well-being, he refuses to sell her any and locks her out of his house. Upset, Rue blames Fez for her addiction. 
                    She calls Ali for help.</p>
